# Design Patterns

This project contains examples of **design patterns** implemented in functional programming. The goal is to provide practical examples that demonstrate how these patterns can be applied efficiently.

## Functional Patterns

- **[Adapter](./patterns-functional/adapter/)**: A structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by adapting one interface to another.
- **[Currying](./patterns-functional/currying/)**: A technique that transforms a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take one argument.
- **[Dependency Injection](./patterns-functional/dependency-injection/)**: A pattern that facilitates injecting external dependencies into components or classes, improving modularity and testability.
- **[Monads](./patterns-functional/monads/)**: A structure that encapsulates a value and provides methods for chaining operations in a safe and predictable way.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new design patterns or improvements, feel free to open a Pull Request.
